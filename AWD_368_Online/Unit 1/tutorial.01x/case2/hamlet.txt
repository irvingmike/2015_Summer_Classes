Hamlet

   One of the greatest plays ever written in the English language, Hamlet is the story of the
   young Danish prince, Hamlet, who learns that his father was killed by his 
   uncle and that the throne of Denmark is now held by this usurper and a murderer.Though filled with 
   grief and the desire for revenge, Hamlet delays action until he is certain of his uncle's guilt. 
   Hamlet hires a theater troupe to stage a play that re-enacts the events of his father's 
   murder, hoping to determine the truth by watching the reaction of his uncle to the play. Hamlet's 
   suspicions are confirmed when the king flees from the performance. As he moves to take revenge upon 
   his uncle, Hamlet errs by killing the king's advisor, Polonius, and is banished from Denmark. Hamlet returns 
   and kills the king, but he and his mother die by poison in the act. The play ends in tragedy but with 
   the promise  of immortality for Hamlet through his soldier's funeral and the recording of his story 
   by his friend Horatio.
