<!--
The following conventions apply to all J2EE deployment descriptor
elements unless indicated otherwise.

- In elements that contain PCDATA, leading and trailing whitespace
  in the data may be ignored.

- In elements whose value is an "enumerated type", the value is
  case sensitive.

- In elements that specify a pathname to a file within the same
  JAR file, relative filenames (i.e., those not starting with "/")
  are considered relative to the root of the JAR file's namespace.
  Absolute filenames (i.e., those starting with "/") also specify
  names in the root of the JAR file's namespace.  In general, relative
  names are preferred.  The exception is .war files where absolute
  names are preferred for consistency with the servlet API.
