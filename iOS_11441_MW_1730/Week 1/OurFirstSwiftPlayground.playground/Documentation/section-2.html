<p>What happened? It displayed &quot;Madison&quot; twice over on the right. That's not very interesting. The second line of code outputs to the console but we don't have a console to see the results, yet. Select the <strong>View➙Assistant Editor➙Show Assistant Editor</strong> menu item. You can also use the keyboard shortcut of <strong>Option-Command-Return</strong> (⌥&#8984;&#9166;). You should get used to the shortcut, you'll be doing this a lot this semester.</p>
