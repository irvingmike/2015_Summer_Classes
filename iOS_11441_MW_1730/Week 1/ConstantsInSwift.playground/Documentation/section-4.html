<p>When you try to set the constant you should see a compiler error like this. If you don't then you need to close the playground and open it again. This is a new technology and they're still working out the bugs.</p>

<h4 id="whatareconstantsgoodfor">What Are Constants Good For?</h4>

<p>The answer is <strong>everything</strong>! This is something where Swift is a little than most languages. In Swift we want to favor using constants as much as possible. If the compiler knows that a value can't change it can do some fast optimizations that it can't on a variable. This gives us our first guideline for coding in Swift.</p>
