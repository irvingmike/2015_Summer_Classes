<p>The following Swift block is commented out. Type in here how you confirmed your answers. Did you use a calculator? It's not enough to just say that, you need to write some values down and describe how you did the calculation. Maybe you found an online source that also did these calculations. <code>(hint)</code> Then you need to paste the site's URL here and write the values you tried with the answers given by the site.</p>
